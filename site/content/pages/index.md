    card_content: |
      Businesses are reawakening to the power of in-house design teams but struggle to understand how best to organise and motivate their people to maximise output and quality.
      
      I help organisations succeed by guiding their design and product teams in improving process, tooling and culture.

    card_title: 'Creative problem-solving workshops'
    card_content: |
      Many organisations struggle to overcome common obstacles because they're not clear on how to proceed; "out of the box" thinking is valued, but can often be elusive. 
      
      I help by supporting teams to unlock unexpected solutions. My custom-designed workshops open untapped creativity, spark wonderful ideas and facilitate fast-failure.

    card_title: 'Bespoke website design & build'
    card_content: |
      Website design and development can be daunting. For organisations intent on building sites that are genuinely centred around the needs of their customers, undertaking the necessary research, testing and iterative design present a formidable barrier to entry.
      
      I help companies, schools and charities to create websites that serve and support their visitors; enhancing relationships and improving brands.
