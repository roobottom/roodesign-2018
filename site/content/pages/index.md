Hi, I’m **Jon Roobottom** — a digital product designer. For the past 20 years, I've worked hands-on and led teams in building apps and websites that people love. 

Now I work with organisiations to help them fix problems with their product design process and culture; as-well as providing practical, hands-on UX design skills.
