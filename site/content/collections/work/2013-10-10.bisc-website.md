          Sometimes it’s the case with busy schools that they don’t have much  in terms of brand visuals and assets. We found it particularly challenging to work with the current version of their emblem depicting the ancient Egyptian god, Throth.
          
          Of course, with a school as fantastic as BISC we wanted to help them out. We created an updated, modern version of Throth as a responsive SVG that gave us the flexibility on the web. We also provided a new, simplified set of standardised brand guidelines that the school could use beyond the web.

I was honoured to lead the design and development of a new website for the British International School in Cairo.

This fabulous institution is a celebration of multiculturalism; their British sensibility juxtaposed with Egyptian hospitality.

This is the story of how our small team brought the school's unique personality to life on the web.
