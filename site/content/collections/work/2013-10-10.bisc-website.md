          Sometimes it’s the case with busy schools that they don’t have much  in terms of brand visuals and assets. We found it particularly challenging to work with the current version of their emblem depicting the ancient Egyptian god, Throth.
          
          Of course, with a school as fantastic as BISC we wanted to help them out. We created an updated, modern version of Throth as a responsive SVG that gave us the flexibility on the web. We also provided a new, simplified set of standardised brand guidelines that the school could use beyond the web.

          Testing told us that around a thrid of visitors were accessing BISC’s existing site on their phones. With a further fifth using tablet-like devices it was clear we had to deliver a great experience for all visitors, no matter what device they used.
          
          We also knew that mobile networks in Egypt were sometimes unrealiable, so we needed an interface that would work even when connection speeds were low. Choosing not to rely on javascript for showing the menu, rather I designed a solution where the menu was always available in the page footer and simply provided a contol to “jump” to the menu without any further loading or waiting. This meant that the menu was always available right away, even if  javascript didn’t load.

          To the untrained eye it makes a lot of sense for a school to run their website and learning tool using the same content management system. At its core Firefly has a ridiculously easy-to-use content editor, so why wouldn’t you reduce the learning curve for content editors and use the same system?
          
          The entire structure of Firefly is built to facilitate teaching and learning. It’s a very different beast from a website CMS and getting it to work as such was a real challenge.
          
          That’s why I’m still really proud of the work the team and I did to bend Firefly to our will and produce a really useable, easy to update website. Sure, we had to make some compromises in the design along the way but it did give the school the power to update every single bit of content and component on the site.

I was honoured to lead the design and development of a new website for the British International School in Cairo.

This fabulous institution is a celebration of multiculturalism; their British sensibility juxtaposed with Egyptian hospitality.

This is the story of how our small team brought the school's unique personality to life on the web.
