      1. **Personalised targets** — not all children have the same target, the Markbook supports freeform targets that are unique to each teacher-child relationship.
      2. **Focus on the individual** — on parents evening, tapping a child allows the teacher to open focus mode; showing only the results for that individual.
      3. **Add any task, anytime** — Not all homework and assignments are set through Firefly. Teachers can add any other marks they wish to capture at the tap of a button. 
      4. **Understand performance at a glance** — by using a single colour scale from light to dark, teachers can understand relative performance across a number of tasks allowing them to take timely interventions.

For **7 years** I played a key role in establishing Firefly’s reputation for design excellence as a **hands-on designer** and later, **Head of Design**. I worked with incredible people on products and websites that helped thousands of teachers, students and parents around the world.

## Design for schools

In the early days, we offered bespoke design services alongside our products. I was responsible for the design and development of websites and custom Firefly themes for some of our schools. 

I wrote about [creating a website for BISC](/work/bisc) that details the typical proceess we followed when working with our customers.

## Going Native

{{ partial:figure set="ios" }}

In 2011, I designed the first generation of our native apps Teacher Planner and Student Planner. These apps brought Firefly's functionality to the iPad and iPhone. 

They allowed teachers to set and mark homework from anywhere—even without an internet connection. Students could now submit homework in ways that worked for them like using the iPhone's camera to submit a photo of their work. At the time, this was pretty revolutionary stuff. 

In 2012, Student Planner was nominated for a [BETT innovation award](https://www.bettshow.com/). 

## A theme for each school

Schools use Firefly everyday, so it’s little wonder they want to inject a little of their own personality. My team and I designed and coded a suite of themes that looked great out of the box but could also be *flavoured* per school. 

Schools simply provided two key-colours and a logo for and the theme _automagically_ adjusts by using tones of those colours throughout — seamlessly matching the brand of the school.

## A consistent user experience on the web

In late 2015 it became painfully clear that something was wrong with Firefly's interface. Years of building new features on top of old had left the UI fragmented. I led a project to review each of Firefly's interface components and establish a new front-end pattern library.

My team and I worked with a consultant to catalogue and iterate over the design of a unified UI.

We then redesigned and rebuilt much of Firefly's web UI using componentised-code wrapped in a custom `node.js` build process.

### Patterns for designers, too!

With our new front-end pattern library in place I turned my attention to using patterns in our design process. I led a project to create a fully-featured [pattern library in Sketch](/work/firefly-pattern-library).

## A Markbook for the 21st Century 

Teachers have multiple ways to store marks from homework and task they've set for their students; in spreadsheets, databases or written on paper. Firefly already did a pretty great job at allowing teachers to set and mark homework, but we didn't really offer anyway to view or make meaning from marks across multiple assignments.

In 2015, my team and I designed a solution: The Firefly Markbook automatically collates all marks from homework and tasks set through Firefly. Teachers can also add tasks completed outside of Firefly meaning all marks are stored centrally.

## Outcomes

> Jon leaves Firefly with a fantastic legacy - a great design team working together within a well designed set of design systems and processes.

Joe Mathewson — Founding Partner, Firefly

During my time at Firefly I saw the company grow from a handful of schools to over 500. Design and ease-of-use were often cited by teachers and students alike as one of the top reasons they liked using Firefly. 

I leave a talanted and experienced team to continue the good work — I can't wait to see what they do next!
