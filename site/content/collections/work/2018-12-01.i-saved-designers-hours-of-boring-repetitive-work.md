          Our huge library contains over 350 separate interface elements across our 4 themes, each with their own set of multi-variant overrides; meaning there's 1000s of possible elements that can be used in any design.
          
          To make all this extreme flexibly manageable I created an innovative `constructions`, `parts` and `patterns` structure that allows for easy discoverability of components. This structure also ensures that each component is equally as easy to use and understand.

How do you ensure youâ€™re producing consistent user interface designs across hundreds of screens with thousands of components?

I lead a project to create a pattern library in Sketch that reduced reparative work for my team and made it easy to provide clear specifications to developers.
