  Firefly have always had a reputation in schools for excellence in design. Brilliant usability and aesthetic appeal are key differentiators.
  
  This didn't happen by accident; I played a key role in building the environment where great work could happen by encouraging design thinking across the business from the start.

## Defining design

Firefly's product designers work in cross-functional squads. Each squad has a designer, developers, a scrum master an a product manager. The design team was also responsible for user research and ideation of new features. The small size of my team meant we faced a couple of challenges:

* **We were responsible for a wide array of design tasks**. How best to ensure all squads had equal design support?
* **Senior designers wanted growth**. How best to support career development without room for upwards movement?

I started by defining exactly was design meant at Firefly. I created a list of skills we needed to provide as a team and plotted our two designer types.

Once we understood the team shape requirements it was simple to help everyone (including me) understand where they needed to improve their skills and where they could help others progress.

We also created design specialist add-on roles that were taken by designers who showed a particular interest in or aptitude for that skill. The idea wasn't that one person was solely responsible for one area, rather they advocate for seeing everyone level-up in that area.

The result was a happier team who had a much clearer idea of what skill or area to work on next. Firefly offered a yearly £1,000 training budget and we were were one of the few teams that consistently spent nearly every penny. 

## Supporting designers in doing their best work

The responsibilities of a design leader are many and varied. You have to bring a mix of in-depth design knowledge and classic management skills. I'm constantly iterating my toolset of techniques to empower my team to do their best work then getting out of the way to allow this to happen.

### One to ones

One to ones are vital in running a healthy, happy team. I ran weekly hour-long 1:1s with all of my team with clear timed sections for work catch-up, Objectives and Key Results review and career support.

### Weekly design meet-up

Every week the whole team would come together for an hour in a safe space where would could share what we'd been working on and offer feedback and constructive criticism.

As the team changed, so did the format of these meeting. Periodically, I'd turn the whole of the meeting over to a format workshop to ensure we were always keeping the format fresh.

## Inclusive and engaging design through workshops

I believe workshops are an essential part of any design process. At their best, workshops unlock untapped creativity in people, spark ideas and facilitate fast-failure.

I've run workshops with internal teams and external clients in many different formats.
