Firefly have always had a reputation in schools for excellence in design. Brilliant usability and aesthetic appeal are key differentiators. This didn't happen by accident: **I hired great people** and created an **environment where great work could happen**.


## Defining design

Firefly's designers work in cross-functional squads. Each squad has designers, developers, a scrum master an a product manager. We were responsible for user research, idea development, UI design and user testing. Although design was valued at Firefly, we were still a relativily small team. This presented a couple of problems:

* **We were responsible for a wide array of design tasks**. How could we ensure all squads had equal design support?
* **Senior designers wanted growth**. How could I support their career development without room for upwards movement?

I started by defining exactly was design meant at Firefly. Creating a list of skills meant I could define roles and responsibilities with greater clarity.

Once we understood the team shape requirements it was simple to help everyone (including me) understand where they needed to improve their skills and where they could help others make progress.

### Design specalists

I created **design specialist add-on roles** that were assigned to designers who showed a particular interest in or aptitude for that skill. It was their job to advocate best practive and for seeing everyone level-up in that area.

The result was a happier team who had a much clearer idea of what skill or area to work on next. Firefly offered a yearly £1,000 training budget and we were were one of the few teams that consistently spent nearly every penny. 

## Supporting design

The responsibilities of a design leader are many and varied. You have to bring a mix of in-depth design knowledge and classic management skills. I'm constantly iterating my toolset of techniques to empower my team to do their best work then getting out of the way to allow this to happen.

### One to ones

One to ones are vital in running a healthy, happy team. I ran weekly hour-long 1:1s with all of my team with clear timed sections for work catch-up, Objectives and Key Results review and career support.

### Weekly design meet-up

Every week the whole team would come together for an hour in a safe space where would could share what we'd been working on and offer feedback and constructive criticism.

As the team changed, so did the format of these meeting. Periodically, I'd turn the whole of the meeting over to a "format workshop" to ensure we were always keeping the format fresh.

### Inclusive and engaging design through workshops

I believe workshops are an essential part of any design process. At their best, workshops unlock untapped creativity in people, spark ideas and facilitate fast-failure.

I've run workshops with internal teams and external clients in many different formats.
