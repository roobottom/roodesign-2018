## From wireframes to visuals

Designing a new website for Exeter School was my first real client job for Firefly. It was also the first time I got to work with a proper UX Designer who I collaborated with in creating wireframes for the school based on the research he'd done to understand the structure of the site.

{{ partial:figure set="wireframe" }}

Once we'd agreed on the site structure and page layouts, I moved on to visual design. I created several different iterations for a homepage and inner page tweaking each time until the client was happy.

## From design to code

This project was also my first foray into the world of custom template development for Firefly. I produced important pages as flat HTML and CSS first before integrating these into Firefly's XSLT theming language. 

## Outcomes

Exeter School got a new responsive website that they could update with Firefly.
