          In the early days, Firefly offered bespoke design services alongside our core product. I was responsible for the design and build of websites for some of our key schools. 
          
          Heading-up a combination of in-house designers and developers I ran this arm of the business almost like a mini agency inside Firefly proper. I think it's a testiment to both the product's ease-of-use and the quality of design that so many big name schools requested our services for their websites.  
          
          For a more in-depth read about how I ran web design at Firefly check out my work on [a website for the British International School in Cairo](/work/bisc-website).

          In 2011, I designed the first generation of our native apps **Teacher Planner** and **Student Planner**. These apps brought Firefly's functionality to the iPad and iPhone. 
          
          They allowed teachers to set and mark homework from anywhere—even without an internet connection. Students could now submit homework in ways that worked for them like using the iPhone's camera to submit a photo of their work. At the time, this was pretty revolutionary stuff. 
          
          In 2012, Student Planner was nominated for a BETT innovation award.

For 7 years I played a key role in establishing Firefly’s reputation for design excellence; both as a hands-on designer and leader of the design and front-end teams.

I'm enormously proud of everything my team and I achieved at Firefly. I worked with some immensely talented people on products that helped thousands of teachers, students and parents to teach, learn and share knowledge.
