How do you ensure you’re producing consistent user interface designs across hundreds of screens with thousands of components?

I lead a project to create a pattern library in Sketch that reduced reparative work for my team and made it easy to provide clear specifications to developers.

Our design process was messy, copying and pasting various bit of interface from one Illustrator file to another was a pain. 

Developers were confused, our designs were inconsistent containing multiple colours and styles, often for the same controls.

Something had to change; enter Sketch, with its symbols, overrides and libraries it offered the kind of functionality we were looking for. It wasn’t an easy project (see my articles about the first and second versions and Aegir's article) but after months of hard work, we now have an amazing tool for designers and developers.

## Hundreds of components, thousands of permutations

Our huge library contains over 350 separate interface elements across our [4 themes](http://themes.fireflylearning.com/), each with their own set of multi-variant overrides; meaning there's 1000s of possible elements that can be used in any design.

To make all this extreme flexibly manageable I created an innovative `constructions`, `parts` and `patterns` structure that allows for easy discoverability of components. 

## Supercharging creativity

We recognised early on that using our pattern library carried an inherent risk. Just like Lego, we now had a kit of standard parts. Our fear was that this would lead to formulaic designs that used predefined UI rather than interfaces that were truly usable and delightful.

We built the fix into our design process by totally ignoring the pattern library.

We introduced a two-phase process of UI ideation and UI artwork. In the first phase, designers are free to solve the problem in whatever way they think best, without having to worry about producing pixel perfect designs. In the second phase we translate our designs to use existing components or propose changes and additions to the library.

The result is that we now have a tool that supports creativity, consistancy and speed but gets out of the way until we need it.

## Better conversations with our developer friends

For all its power, our pattern library alone doesn't offer any benefits for developers. Alongside the pattern library we developed a style guide.

Our style guide documents each component in all possible states.  We share the style guide via Zeplin, which allows developers to inspect each element to understand its make-up. And because we share predefined colour variables across design and development, they can call these directly in SASS.
