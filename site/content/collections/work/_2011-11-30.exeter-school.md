## From wireframes to visuals

Designing a new website for Exeter School was my first real client job for Firefly. It was also the first time I got to work with a proper UX Designer who I collaborated with in creating wireframes for the school based on the research he'd done to understand the structure of the site.

Once we'd agreed on the site structure and page layouts, I moved on to visual design. I created several different iterations for a homepage and inner page tweaking each time until the client was happy.

## From design to code

This project was also my first foray into the world of custom template development for Firefly. I produced important pages as flat HTML and CSS first before integrating these into Firefly's XSLT theming language.
