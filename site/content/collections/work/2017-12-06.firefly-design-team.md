          Firefly's product designers work in cross-functional squads. Each squad has a designer, developers, a scrum master an a product manager. The design team was also responsible for user research and ideation of new features. The small size of my team meant we faced a couple of challenges:
          
          * **We were responsible for a wide array of design tasks**. How best to ensure all squads had equal design support?
          * **Senior designers wanted growth**. How best to support career development without room for upwards movement?
          
          I started by defining exactly was design meant at Firefly: By creating a list of skills we needed to function as a team; then used this to plot the shape of our two designer "types".

          Once we understood the team shape requirements it was simple to help everyone (including me) understand where they needed to improve their skills and where they could help others progress.
          
          We also created design specialist add-on roles that were taken by designers who showed a particular interest in or aptitude for that skill. The idea wasn't that one person was solely responsible for one area, rather they advocate for seeing everyone level-up in that area.
          
          The result was a happier team who had a much clearer idea of what skill or area to work on next. Firefly offered a yearly £1,000 training budget and we were were one of the few teams that consistently spent nearly every penny.

          The responsibilities of a design leader are many and varied. You have to bring a mix of in-depth design knowledge and classic management skills. I'm constantly iterating my toolset of techniques to empower my team to do their best work then getting out of the way to allow this to happen.
          
          ### One to ones
          One to ones are vital in running a healthy, happy team. I ran weekly hour-long 1:1s with all of my team with clear timed sections for work catch-up, Objectives and Key Results review and career support.
          
          ### Weekly design meet-up
          Every week the whole team would come together for an hour in a safe space where would could share what we'd been working on and offer feedback and constructive criticism.
          
          As the team changed, so did the format of these meeting. Periodically, I'd turn the whole of the meeting over to a format workshop to ensure we were always keeping the format fresh.

          I believe workshops are an essential part of any design process. At their best, workshops unlock untapped creativity in people, spark ideas and facilitate fast-failure.
          
          I've run workshops with internal teams and external clients in many different formats. Typically, a day-long workshop might look like this:
          
          ### Morning (diverge)
          * 30m Introduction + job to be done presentation 
          * 10m Crazy 8s
          * 20m 3xBig idea sketching
          * 30m Presentations
          * 10m Heat map voting
          * 50m Repeat last three steps (remix and improve)
          
          ### Afternoon (converge)
          * 40m solution sketching
          * 40m presentations
          * 20m feedback and q&a 
          * 10m heat map voting

          The lead designer on a project would then work-up the best 2 or 3 ideas from the day into prototypes we could test.
          
          I also encouraged the design team to use elements of these workshops as part of their every-day process to constantly drive their thinking forward.

          ### What?
          My team were responsible for helping to define what we should build through user research and testing. UX Researchers owned this part of the process and split their time between:
          
          * **Generative research:** developing a deep understanding of our users and their needs to create innovative ideas of how Firefly could help them in-line with our mission and strategy (“why”).
          * **Idea validation:** testing ideas with real users and their feasibility with internal teams.
          * **Feature validation:** at the end of the proccess, understanding the impact of recently shipped features on squad-level KPIs.
          
          ### How?
          My team were responsible for define solutions to user stories through creative design and testing. UI Designers owned their part of the process and split their time between:
          
          * **Solution ideation:** create ingenious solutions to problems for teachers, parents and students through fail-fast, iterative design.
          * **Solution validation:** testing then iterating solutions with real user via increasing fidelity prototypes.
          * **Solution feasibility:** working alongside product managers to ensure that solutions are technically feasible and align with sales and producut-marketing strategies.

Firefly have always had a reputation for excellence in design. Brilliant usability and aesthetic appeal are key differentiators.

This didn't happen by accident; I played a key role in building the environment where great work could happen by encouraging design thinking across the business from the start.
